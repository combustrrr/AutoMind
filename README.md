## AutoMind Car Recommender (NEW!)

### 🌟 Natural Language Car Search

AutoMind now includes an intelligent car recommendation system that understands natural language queries!

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Option 1: Web UI (Streamlit - Recommended for demo)
pip install streamlit
streamlit run automind_ui.py

# Option 2: Command Line Interface (No installation needed)
python automind_cli.py
```

### 📋 Example Queries

Try these natural language queries:
- "A Toyota SUV under 20 lakhs"
- "Luxury electric sedan above 50L"
- "Cheap Maruti hatchback under 10L"
- "Premium BMW sedan"
- "Budget friendly diesel car from Hyundai"

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **Type your query** in natural language
2. **NLP Engine** extracts features (brand, type, fuel, price, luxury)
3. **Guessing Engine** scores cars from database
4. **Get recommendations** ranked by match score

### ✨ Advanced Features

- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles typos (e.g., "Tayota" → "Toyota")
- **Synonym Support**: "EV" → "electric", "crossover" → "SUV"
- **Compound Queries**: Multiple features in one sentence
- **Negation Handling**: "not diesel" excludes diesel cars
- **Smart Inference**: Infers luxury from brand/price
- **🆕 Smart Clarification**: Asks for details when confidence is low (< 30%)
