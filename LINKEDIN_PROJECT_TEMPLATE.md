### Description

**Option 1: Concise (Recommended - 800 chars)**

A sophisticated AI-powered car expert system featuring dual modes: an Akinator-style guessing game and intelligent car recommendation engine. Built with 1,050+ real Indian market cars, implementing 14+ AI concepts including expert systems, inference engines, Bayesian reasoning, and information theory.

The guessing mode uses entropy-based question selection to identify any car in 4-6 strategic questions, while the recommendation mode employs content-based filtering with multi-criteria decision making to suggest perfect car matches based on user preferences.

Implemented using Python with modular architecture (1,832 LOC), featuring knowledge base with frame-based representation, forward/backward chaining inference, constraint satisfaction, and Streamlit web interface. Demonstrates production-quality code with session logging, real-time probability updates, and intelligent question optimization.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, Pandas | **Concepts:** Expert Systems, Knowledge Representation, Inference Engines, Recommendation Systems, Information Theory, Bayesian Reasoning

**Option 2: Detailed (Full 2,000 chars)**

AutoMind is a comprehensive AI application that demonstrates advanced artificial intelligence through two interactive modes: an Akinator-style car guessing game and an intelligent car recommendation engine. The system processes 1,050+ real vehicles from the Indian automotive market using expert system architecture.

**Guessing Mode (Akinator-style):**
Think of any car, and the AI identifies it through 4-6 strategically selected questions. Uses information theory (entropy/Gini impurity) to maximize information gain with each question, maintaining a Bayesian belief state that updates probabilities across all 1,050 hypotheses. Implements forward and backward chaining inference, constraint satisfaction (e.g., electric cars skip engine questions), and achieves 30%+ confidence scores.

**Recommendation Mode:**
Content-based filtering system that matches user preferences (brand, budget, fuel type, body type, luxury level, era, usage) with ideal cars. Employs multi-criteria decision making to rank all vehicles and present top 10 matches with detailed explanations and match scores.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Expert system architecture with modular design (15 Python files, 1,832 LOC)
- Knowledge base: Frame-based car representation with 15+ attributes per vehicle
- Inference engine: Forward/backward chaining with rule-based reasoning
- Question selection: Information gain maximization using entropy algorithms
- Belief state management: Bayesian probability updates with aggressive discrimination
- UI: Interactive Streamlit web interface with real-time updates
- Session logging: JSON-based tracking for both modes
- Code quality: Type hints, comprehensive docstrings, error handling

**Key Achievements:**
- Reduced questions from 10+ to 4-6 using information theory optimization
- Implemented 14+ AI concepts in single cohesive system
- Built production-ready code with professional architecture
- Processed and enriched real-world Kaggle dataset

Demonstrates expertise in classical AI (expert systems, symbolic reasoning) and modern approaches (recommendation systems, ML integration) with practical real-world application.
