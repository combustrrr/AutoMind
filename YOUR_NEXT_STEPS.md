1. **Guessing Mode (Akinator-style)**
   - Think of any car from 1,050 options
   - AI asks 4-6 strategic questions to identify it
   - Uses information theory (entropy/Gini impurity)
   - Achieves 30%+ confidence in identification

2. **Recommendation Mode**
   - Tell the AI your preferences (brand, budget, fuel, etc.)
   - Get top 10 car recommendations instantly
   - Uses content-based filtering

**Project Name:**
```
AutoMind — AI Car Expert System
```

**Description (Concise - 800 characters):**
```
A sophisticated AI-powered car expert system featuring dual modes: an Akinator-style guessing game and intelligent car recommendation engine. Built with 1,050+ real Indian market cars, implementing 14+ AI concepts including expert systems, inference engines, Bayesian reasoning, and information theory.

The guessing mode uses entropy-based question selection to identify any car in 4-6 strategic questions, while the recommendation mode employs content-based filtering with multi-criteria decision making to suggest perfect car matches based on user preferences.

Implemented using Python with modular architecture (1,832 LOC), featuring knowledge base with frame-based representation, forward/backward chaining inference, constraint satisfaction, and Streamlit web interface. Demonstrates production-quality code with session logging, real-time probability updates, and intelligent question optimization.

Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, Pandas | Concepts: Expert Systems, Knowledge Representation, Inference Engines, Recommendation Systems, Information Theory, Bayesian Reasoning
