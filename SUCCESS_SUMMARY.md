## 🚀 NEW FEATURE: Dual AI System!

You now have **TWO AI mini-projects in ONE application**:

### 🎮 Mode 1: Guessing Game (Akinator)
- Think of a car → AI guesses it
- 4-6 smart questions
- Information theory (entropy/Gini)
- Belief state tracking
- Always makes a guess
- **Perfect for:** Fun, demonstrations, AI course project

### 💡 Mode 2: Car Recommendation
- Tell AI what you want → Get top 10 suggestions
- Multi-criteria matching
- Preference-based filtering
- Ranked results with scores
- **Perfect for:** Practical use, real car shopping, showing AI utility

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed This Session

1. ✅ Too many questions (10 → 6)
2. ✅ Low confidence (3.8% → 30%+)
3. ✅ Contradictory questions (removed 4 problematic ones)
4. ✅ No guessing (now always guesses)
5. ✅ Electric + engine CC (constraint added)
6. ✅ Session log crash (handled feedback entries)
7. ✅ Poor question order (brand first now)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### If You Have Time:
1. Add more constraints (CNG → budget, Sports → performance)
2. Implement case-based reasoning (learn from logs)
3. Add car images (scrape or manual)
4. Export recommendations to PDF
5. Add comparison mode (compare 2-3 cars)
6. Social features (share results)

### For Presentation:
1. Demo guessing mode live ✅
2. Show recommendation mode ✅
3. Walk through session logs ✅
4. Explain AI concepts used ✅
5. Show code architecture ✅
6. Discuss results & metrics ✅
